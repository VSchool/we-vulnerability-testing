# VS - Work Experience Vulnerability Test

### Overview
This project is intended to give students a chance to diagnose and recommend security fixes on a containerized web application and authentication server.

### Requirements
You will need to install the following dependencies:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Remote Development VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) 
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass)


### Run the Application
- From VS Code, click the 'Open A Remote Window' button (it's blue) in the bottom left corner of the window.
- Select 'Clone Repository in Container Volume'.
- Paste the URL of this repository (`https://github.com/VSchool/we-vulnerability-testing.git`) and hit enter.
- Once the terminal displays a message that the server and database are connected, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a browser to view the app.

### Inspecting the Database
Open MongoDB Compass and enter `mongodb://localhost:27017` into the URI field, and click enter. Select the database 'test' from the side menu to view the collection of users. To create a user simply sign up using the web app. You may need to refresh Compass to see new entries.
